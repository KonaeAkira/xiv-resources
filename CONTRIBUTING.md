# Contributing
Thank you for contributing! Here are a few guidelines to follow before you post:

Websites that fall under multiple categories may be added multiple times, such as [Universalis](https://universalis.app), which is both a website and a web API.

Websites that have multiple distinct entries under a single category may have each entry added separately, such as [exdreams](https://exdreams.net/), which has a variety of distinct web applications on it.

Just some quick NOs:
* No Discord (or other chat) servers - There are a million of them. Likewise for forums. Websites that *have* a forum or a server associated with them are perfectly fine, as long as the website is not only a means of having people join a forum/server.
* No chat bots - They're easy to make, and there are tons of them.
* No TexTools mods - See above. Exceptions might be made for UI mods.
* No Dalamud plugins that are in the main plugin repository already.
* No XIVAPI clients that are on the GitHub organization already.

The exception to all of this is that I *will* accept aggregators of the above. For example, [XIV Mod Archive](https://www.xivmodarchive.com/) is linked, but specific mods are not.

"Cheating" software will be added at my own discretion; what crosses that line will be decided very arbitrarily.

## Sorting
Entries within each table should be alphabetized.
